**Client-side validations:**

- Date: Required, not in past
- Time: Required selection
- Vehicle Type: Required selection
- Vehicle Model: Required, non-empty

## 💾 Data Storage (Demo)

Currently uses **localStorage** for demo purposes:
```javascript
// Bookings stored as: bookings = [{
//   serviceId: 1,
//   serviceName: "Engine Repair",
//   name: "John Doe",
//   email: "john@example.com",
//   phone: "+1 (555) 123-4567",
//   date: "2024-11-15",
//   time: "09:00",
//   vehicleType: "Sedan",
//   vehicleModel: "2020 Honda Civic",
//   additionalNotes: "...",
//   createdAt: "2024-10-27T..."
// }]
```

**To integrate with backend:**
1. Replace localStorage calls with API endpoints
2. Update `appointmentService.js` with create booking endpoint
3. Add error handling for API failures
