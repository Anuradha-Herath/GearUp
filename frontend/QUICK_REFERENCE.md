## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Form not showing
**Solution**: Ensure user is logged in. Check `useAuth()` returns `isAuthenticated: true`

### Issue: Date picker showing past dates
**Solution**: Already implemented - `min={today}` prevents selecting past dates

### Issue: Service details not loading
**Solution**: Make sure you're passing `service` object via location state when navigating

### Issue: localStorage not persisting
**Solution**: Check browser allows localStorage. Some incognito windows don't.

   - Easily customizable in `BookingForm.jsx`

3. **Vehicle Type Flexibility**

4. **Form Validation**
   - All validations are client-side (instant feedback)
